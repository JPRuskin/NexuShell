# TreasureChest Documentation

You've found the online documentation for [TreasureChest](https://github.com/steviecoaster/TreasureChest)!

TreasureChest is a PowerShell module for the [Sonatype Nexus Repository Server](https://www.sonatype.com/products/repository-oss) API. Each function inside of the module links back to its corresponding page here on the docs site.

## What is Sonatype Nexus

Sonatype Nexus is a Repository Server that exists in two flavors. Open Source (Sonatype Nexus OSS), and Pro (Sonatype Nexus Pro). The open-source version of Sonatype Nexus is extremely feature rich, providing you _almost_ all of the functionality of the Pro edition. It only lacks things like Azure Blob Storage availability for use in Blob Stores, High Availability, and Blob Store migrations, and a Support contract.

## Functionality

## Building

While in development there is no official module up on the PSGallery. If you'd like to take it for a spin while I'm working on it, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo and run `.\build.ps1 -Build` from the cloned folder
2. Import the module with `Import-Module .\Output\TreasureChest\TreasureChest.psd1` from the cloned folder
3. Discover the available commands with `Get-Command -Module TreasureChest`
4. Explore the available commands with `Get-Help`
5. Start having fun!

Once I have complete API coverage I'll publish this to the Gallery, and from there you'll be able to do `Install-Module TreasureChest`, `Update-Module TreasureChest` etc
